### How It Works:
- customer makes a booking in advance 
- payment is held in an escrow contract, e.g. 50 DAI, until the time of the haircut 
- during this time, funds are placed in Aave V2 to earn interest 

when the haircut is done:
- an arbiter approves that the haircut is complete to a good standard 
- the customer gets some of the accrued interest 
- the barber gets some of the accrued interest as well (as an incentive to use this dapp) 


- the earlier the customer makes the booking, the more interest they can get


if a customer cancels the booking: 
- the barber gets the interest earned (another incentive to use this dapp) 
- the customer only gets back their deposit
